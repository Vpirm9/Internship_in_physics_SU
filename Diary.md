# Diary

The file consist of daily updates of the work done during the internship. Generaly the tasks done are described, sometimes some notes are also added. Codes and other files are usually saved to the repository and not added to diary, to increase transparency.


## 14.10.2021
- I have read the segment from a Phd thesis about 3D absorbers by Mattew Petroff.
- I have read M. Petroff et. all. a 3D-printed broadband mmm wave absorbers (https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5050781
- Difference betwen FFF (fused filament fabrication) and (LFS) Low Force Stereolithography printers. 

## 15.10.2021
- Started reading S. Staggs (https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6633/aa94d5)
- CMB data mostly as maps (COBE 1989-1993, WMAP 2001-2010, PLANCK 2009-2013)
- Sources of the polarisation of CMB (Thomson scattering, Gravitational waves, ...)

## 18.10.2021
- Reading S. Sttags, part about CMB observations inpact on cosmology topics.

## 19.11.2021
- Reading S. Sttags, part about different modes and polarisation aptterns.

## 20.11.2021
- Weekly meeting, discussion about future reading (cosmology basics ...)
- Reading S. Sttags, Gravitational lensing and SZ effect.

## 21.11.2021
- Reading S. Sttags, measuring methods of CMB bacground.


## 28.11.2021 
- Weekly meeting. Discussion about different modes of CMB, meaning of l-spectrum.
- We decided, that I will try to follow CMB Analysis Summer School at Univesrity of Michigan material by Jeff McMahon(https://github.com/jeffmcm1977/CMBAnalysis_SummerSchool). We decided, that I should also check the python library healpy.

## 4.11.2021
- Weekly meeting. We checked the current advancement with CMB Analysis summer school. We decided, that I should write lab diary in the form of Jupyter notebooks on Github. We also decided, that I need to check for suitable models for test prints using Formlabs 3.

## 7.11.2021
- Reinstalled anaconda
- Properly installed jupyter notebook
- Started GitHub repository
- Succesfuly run healpay inside Oracle VirtualBox. I wasn't able to succesfully install it on Windows machine. Since virtual machine isn't ideal another suitable option should be found, either in form of remote machine or dual boot.

## 9.11.2021
- Checked for some suitable test models for 3D printing.

## 11.11.2021
-  We had a wekly meeting and discussed the current work progress. 
-  We talked about basics of using Formlabs2
-  I made a Formlabs account and start with test prints (Test prints repository).

## 12.11.2021
- I removed test prints from the printer.
- I washed and cured them.
- The dimensions of prints were measured, and tolerances were estimated. Future attention should be dedicated to avoiding varping of parts during the curing proces, becouse the first prints would be practically useless due to significat warp.

## 16.11.2021
- Started with test printing of absorber, for which the files were provided together with code from M. Pettrof.
- Original model was cut using thinkercad, to fit into the buildplate (approx. 130x130 mm)

## 17.11.2021
- I figured out, that printer didn't even started printing the prewious night since it encountered "The cartidge is empty or jammed error".
- I did some troubleshooting, but I didnt find the couse.
- I changed the grej resin for clear.
- I calibrated the resin leve sensor.
- I suspect, thet the error is conected with resni level folat, which fells, that is kinda "sticking".

## 18.11.2021
- I rebooted the printer and the error went away. I started printing the absorber.
- I tried to get python code to work, first on my Win10 machine, then also on Mac in the lab. I get  "ImportError: cadquery was unable to determine freecad library path" error constantly.

## 19.11.2021
- The print was finished, Therefore I started with cleaning. I did 15 min washing and 60 min curing at 60 degrees.
- Small warp was observed in the printed absorber.
- I collected the delivery of IPA.
- I removed the used IPA from the Formlabs washer and put in in the prewash tank.
- I checked the python code with help of Alex A. 
- We get it to work on Mac, and generated some Gosper curve absorbers.
- The code still doesnt run on win machine.

## 23.11.2021
- Collected delivery of new resin.
- I investigated the previous print of the absorber and found out some errors in the print, which can be coused by deformation in the printer silicone film. Deformation was most likely coused by the fallen support, which wass presssed into film by laser head and build plate. So part of the film in this try is useless for serious prints.
- I generated some designs with different parameters and printed two of them, one with Gasper curve and one with Hilbert curve printed vertically.

## 24.11.2021
- I 3D printed small hilbert curve absorbers with different supports.
- I figured out, how to manully add suports in PreForm.
- I cured prints and observed resoults. Due to small absorber size there was no significant warping.
- I cured prints with different settings, according to datasheet (fast cure, vs. full cure).

## 26.11.2021
- I compared different options for converting .stl files (Solidworks vs. online tools). Theoretically this can be done in FreeCAD, altough online converters are much simple. There is data protection concern tho... But I would prefear that, since in SolidWorks it's not so simple.

## 1.12.2021
- I started learning how to draw 3D models in CADquerry from scratch.
- I succeded in making one element of pyramide-shaped absorber.

## 2.12.2021
- I finsihed designing pyramide shaped absorber.
- I printed pyramide shaped absorber.
- I started reading about different absorer geometries (dog leg absorber)

## 3.12.2021
- I cured pyramide shaped absorber and cured it.
- I observed quite siggnificant warp, which appeared during curing process.
