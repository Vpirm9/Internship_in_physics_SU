The article describes producing microwave absorbers produced with the following SLS printer: http://en.farsoon.com/solution_list01_detail/FrontColumns_navigation01-1497538545688FirstColumnId=2&FrontColumns_navigation01-1497538545688SecondColumnId=55&productId=26.html
I think we can’t achieve the same results with Form 3, but it might be useful to understand how they tested their specimens. But they also coated their powder-based prints with the mixture of epoxy resin (ER) and polyamide resin (PU) with a mass ratio of 10:1 and  50% vol% CIP powder was added. I need to do some additional reading, but this might also be an interesting material option for our prints.

Another sample of microwave absorber produced with a DLA printer, but I think it can be reproduced with Form 3. They used quite advanced graphene based additives to the resin. I need to go deeper into understanding the paper, mostly because it is a little bit more chemical.

A short review of available 3D printing methods. The only useful info might be concern with material properties of SLA prints.

The article about producing paracetamol pills with Formlabs printer using edible photo- solidifying compound. Not really useful for our case, but might also include some useful reference.

Calculation of absorption in multilayer composite absorber, not sure if it applies for our purpose, but we should keep in mind that the layer structure of absorbers may have some effect.

The article about theoretically predicting the amount of carbon fiber paste and (glas?) microbalons. The “host material” (resin) is not described. The power reflection coefficient,  natural logarithm of modulus of permittivity and loss tangent of dielectric as dependent on carbon content.

Article about making pyramid shaped microwave absorber using combination of Urea-Formaldehyde and Phenol-Formaldehyde resin with rice husk. This article basically addresses the same problem as we are approaching. THey use rice-husk as an additive to resin, but they assume that the carbon inside rice could be the main agent which absorbs waves, although some additional research is needed to make that clear. Although I don’t feel that the rice husk will be the most logical choice even if we get it in the form of powder and are actually able to print with it. But we can definitely figure out which agent inside the husk has the most important role and we can use that as our additive to resin. According to Wikipedia, the rice husk ash can be also an interesting material, since it can be in the form of really fine powder.
