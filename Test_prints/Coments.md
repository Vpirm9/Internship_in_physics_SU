## Coments of test 3D prints

It was observed, that smole details are printed with precision under 0.15 mm. It's worth commenting that the measurements were made usinf vernier caliper with resolution 0.05 mm. I assume this is usefull for our applications, and especially good compared to my previous experience using FFF 3D printers.

It was oserved, that the 20 min deafult washing program isn't sufficient for dissolving of the resin in small holes. Therefore the time should be extendet, maby mechanicall cleaning would also make sense.

The plate-shaped parts gained significat warp during curing on 60Â°C under UV light for 30 min. The curing process should be modified in order, to avoid this efect, which basicallly made the parts useless. Full understanding of the phenomena should be considered.
